## Customer Health Scoring

### Health Factors (weighted)

- **Support Activity** (20%): Ticket volume and resolution time
- **Relationship Depth** (25%): Multi-threading and champion strength
- **Business Outcomes** (25%): Value realization and ROI achievement

### Scoring Methodology
```python
def calculate_health_score(customer_data):
    usage_score = analyze_product_usage(customer_data['usage'])
    support_score = analyze_support_activity(customer_data['support'])
    relationship_score = analyze_relationships(customer_data['contacts'])
    outcome_score = analyze_business_outcomes(customer_data['outcomes'])
    
    weighted_score = (
        usage_score * 0.30 +
        support_score * 0.20 +
        relationship_score * 0.25 +
        outcome_score * 0.25
    )
    
    return {
        'overall': weighted_score,
        'status': get_health_status(weighted_score),
        'factors': {
            'usage': usage_score,
            'support': support_score,
            'relationship': relationship_score,
            'outcomes': outcome_score
        },
        'recommendations': generate_recommendations(weighted_score, customer_data)
    }
```
