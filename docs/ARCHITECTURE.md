## 🔗 System Components

### 1. Customer Intelligence System

Manages comprehensive customer profiles with multi-tier context generation:
- **Compact (5K tokens)**: Quick updates, health checks
- **Standard (40K tokens)**: Meeting prep, deal reviews  
- **Extended (200K+ tokens)**: Deep analysis, strategic planning

#### Customer Profile Structure
- Company information and industry details
- Contact mapping with stakeholder roles
- Deal progression and health metrics
- Complete interaction history
- AI-generated insights and recommendations

### 2. Intelligent Reporting System

#### Three-Tier Reporting
- **Personal Reports**: Daily performance tracking for individuals
- **Team Reports**: Strategic insights for leadership
- **Pulse Reports**: Real-time actionable alerts

#### Automated Generation
```python
from reporting.personal.ae_report import AEReport

report = AEReport()
context = {
    'user_id': 'john.smith',
    'time_period': 'last_7_days',
    'include_goals': True
}
output = report.generate(context)
```

### 3. AI Agent Ecosystem

#### Agent Categories
- **Customer Intelligence**: Context analysis and insights
- **Sales Support**: Deal progression and strategy
- **Automation**: Trigger monitoring and actions
- **Analytics**: Report generation and analysis

#### Integration Framework
```yaml
customer-context-analyzer:
  purpose: Analyze customer interactions and provide insights
  tools: [email_search, slack_search, gong_analysis]
  output: Comprehensive customer context summary

deal-progression-agent:
  purpose: Identify next best actions for deal advancement
  tools: [crm_query, pipeline_analysis, competitor_check]
  output: Prioritized action recommendations
```

### 4. Trigger Automation Engine

Continuous monitoring and automated response system:

```python
# Example trigger configuration
trigger_rules = {
    'buying_signals': {
        'keywords': ['budget approved', 'looking for solution'],
        'actions': ['notify_ae', 'create_task', 'update_forecast']
    },
    'churn_risk': {
        'conditions': ['health_score < 40', 'no_activity > 30'],
        'actions': ['alert_csm', 'escalate_to_manager']
    }
}
```

### 5. Integration Layer

#### Connected Systems
- **CRM**: Salesforce for opportunity management
- **Communication**: Email, Slack for interactions
- **Meetings**: Gong call recording, Granola notes
- **Analytics**: Usage data and billing insights
