## Role
Former FBI negotiator, author of *Never Split the Difference*

## Priorities
- Tactical empathy - understanding emotions behind positions
- Emotional control under pressure
- Influencing behavior without triggering resistance
- Getting counterpart to solve your problem
- Creating collaborative dynamics from adversarial ones

## How He "Sells"

### Core Techniques

#### Mirroring
Repeat last 1-3 words with upward inflection
- Customer: "The pricing is just too high"
- You: "Too high?"
- Encourages elaboration without confrontation

#### Labeling
Acknowledge emotions without agreeing
- "It seems like budget is a major concern..."
- "It sounds like you're frustrated with current solution..."
- "It feels like timeline is critical here..."

#### Calibrated Questions
Open-ended questions that make them solve your problem
- "How am I supposed to do that?"
- "What's the biggest challenge you see?"
- "What happens if we do nothing?"

#### The Accusation Audit
Address negatives upfront
- "You probably think we're just another vendor..."
- "I'm sure you're skeptical about switching..."
- "You might be wondering why you should trust a startup..."

## How to Win With This Style

### In Discovery
- Use mirroring to go deeper
- Label concerns to surface hidden objections
- Ask "What's the biggest challenge?" repeatedly
- Avoid "Why" questions (feels accusatory)

### In Negotiation
- Start with "No" - "Is now a bad time?"
- Get to "That's right" not just "Yes"
- Use "How am I supposed to do that?" for unreasonable requests
- Create illusion of control through questions

### In Objection Handling
- Label the emotion behind objection
- Use calibrated questions to redirect
- Avoid defending immediately
- Let silence do heavy lifting

## Key Phrases

### Slowing Things Down
- "Let's take a step back..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "It seems like there's more to this..."

### Creating Collaboration
- "How can we solve this together?"
- "What would success look like for you?"
- "How do we move forward from here?"

### Handling Pressure
- "I want to find a way to make this work..."
- "That's a fair point, and..."
- "How can we address your concern about..."

## Practical Applications

### Price Objection
**Customer**: "Your price is 50% higher than competition"

**Wrong**: "But we have better features..."

**Right**: "50% higher?" (mirror)
"It sounds like price is the main concern...(label)
What happens to your project if you go with the cheaper option?" (calibrated question)

### Stalled Deal
**Situation**: No response for two weeks

**Wrong**: "Just checking in..."

**Right**: "Have you given up on fixing [their pain point]?"
(Forces a "No" and re-engagement)

### End of Quarter Pressure
**Your Need**: Close this month

**Wrong**: "We need to close this month"

**Right**: "What's your timeline look like? (calibrated question)
It seems like Q1 implementation would be ideal...(label)
How do we make sure you hit your Q1 goals?" (their problem)

## Advanced Techniques

### The 7-38-55 Rule
- 7% words
- 38% tone
- 55% body language
Focus on tone especially on calls

### The Late Night FM DJ Voice
- Slow down
- Lower tone
- Calm and reassuring
- Use in tense situations

### Strategic Umbrage
- Controlled display of disappointment
- "I'm surprised you think that..."
- Use sparingly for effect

## When This Style Works Best
- High-stakes negotiations
- Emotional buyers
- Adversarial situations
- Price negotiations
- Saving stalled deals

## When to Avoid
- Technical deep dives
- Process-oriented buyers
- When speed is critical
- Low-emotion transactions

## Practice Scenarios

1. **Customer says**: "We don't have budget"
   **You say**: "Don't have budget?" (mirror) then silence

2. **Customer says**: "I need to think about it"
   **You say**: "It seems like you have some concerns...(label) What's the biggest hesitation?"

3. **Customer says**: "Send me a proposal"
   **You say**: "Happy to. What specifically would you like to see in it?"

## Remember
- Never be mean to someone who can hurt you by doing nothing
- "No" is the start of negotiation, not the end
- Body language and tone matter more than words
- The person asking questions has control
- Tactical empathy doesn't mean being nice

The goal isn't to strong-arm - it's to understand deeply and guide collaboratively to mutual success.
