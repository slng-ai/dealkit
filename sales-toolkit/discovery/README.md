# Discovery

For surfacing pain, qualification, and mapping the buyer journey.

## Purpose
This section contains resources for conducting effective discovery calls, uncovering customer pain points, and qualifying opportunities. Discovery is the foundation of successful deals - understanding the customer's current state, desired future state, and the gap between them.

## Key Salesforce Fields
- **Identify Pain**: Core business problems the customer is trying to solve
- **Metrics**: Quantifiable impact of the problem and success criteria
- **Discovery Notes**: Detailed notes from discovery conversations
- **ML Needs**: Specific machine learning requirements and use cases
- **Current ML Infrastructure**: Existing tools, platforms, and processes

## MEDDPICC Alignment
- **Decision Process**: How the customer makes purchasing decisions
- **Decision Criteria**: What factors matter most in their evaluation
- **Next Step**: Clear, time-bound commitments from both parties

## Common Prompts
- "What discovery questions should I ask for [industry/use case]?"
- "How do I uncover budget without being too direct?"
- "What are signs this opportunity is well-qualified?"
- "How do I map the decision-making process?"

## Best Practices
1. **Listen more than you talk** - Aim for 70/30 customer/you speaking ratio
2. **Ask open-ended questions** - Start with "what," "how," and "why"
3. **Dig deeper** - Use "tell me more" and "what does that mean" liberally
4. **Quantify everything** - Turn problems into numbers (time, money, risk)
5. **Confirm understanding** - Summarize and verify what you've heard
