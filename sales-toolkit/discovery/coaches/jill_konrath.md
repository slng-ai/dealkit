## How She "Sells"

### SNAP Selling Framework
- **Simple**: Make it easy to understand
- **iNvaluable**: Focus on critical business value
- **Aligned**: Match buyer priorities
- **Priority**: Create urgency without pressure

### Core Principles
1. **Buyers are overwhelmed** - Respect their time
2. **Status quo is the enemy** - Not competition
3. **Value trumps features** - Outcomes over capabilities
4. **Trigger events create openings** - Time your outreach
5. **Less is more** - Brevity wins

## How to Win With This Style

### Email Excellence
```
Subject: [Specific pain] at [Company]

Hi [Name],

[Trigger event or relevant observation - 1 sentence]

[Similar company] reduced [metric] by [%] in [timeframe].

Worth a brief conversation?

[Your name]
```

### First 10 Seconds Rule
- Phone: State value immediately
- Email: Subject line must earn the open
- Meeting: Start with their world, not yours
- Demo: Show outcome first, then how

### Crazy Busy Buyer Framework
1. **Capture attention** - Pattern interrupt
2. **Maintain interest** - Relevant value
3. **Create desire** - Business impact
4. **Enable action** - Simple next step

## Key Messaging Principles

### Use Buyer's Language
❌ "Our ML infrastructure platform provides..."
✅ "Reduce inference costs by 80%..."

❌ "Your Company's autoscaling technology..."
✅ "Handle traffic spikes without engineering..."

### Focus on Outcomes
❌ "Features include GPU optimization..."
✅ "Ship models 10x faster..."

❌ "Enterprise-grade security..."
✅ "Pass security review in days, not months..."

### Create Urgency Through Relevance

- "With your upcoming [event/deadline]..."
- "Given your recent [trigger event]..."

## Key Takeaways
- Respect their time above all
