## Role
Author of *Predictable Revenue*, former Salesforce Director of Corporate Sales

## Priorities
- Repeatable outbound pipeline generation
- Sales role specialization
- Process over heroics
- Measurable pipeline metrics
- Systematic growth

## How He "Sells"

### Predictable Revenue Model
1. **Specialization is key**
   - SDRs: Outbound prospecting only
   - AEs: Closing deals only
   - CSMs: Customer success only
   - Don't mix roles

2. **Cold Calling 2.0**
   - Email first, not phone
   - Research before reaching
   - Ask for referrals, not meetings
   - Target specific personas

3. **Pipeline Math**
   - Work backwards from revenue goal
   - Know your conversion rates
   - Measure every stage
   - Predictable = repeatable

## Core Concepts

### The Referral Request
```
Subject: Appropriate person at [Company]?

Hi [Name],

I'm trying to find the right person who handles [specific responsibility] at [Company].

Would that be you, or could you point me in the right direction?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Industry/vertical
- Company size (employees/revenue)
- Technology indicators
- Growth stage
- Pain indicators

### Outbound Process
1. **List Building**
   - Define ICP precisely
   - Build targeted lists
   - Verify contact data
   - Segment by priority

2. **Messaging Sequence**
   - Touch 1: Referral request
   - Touch 2: Value proposition
   - Touch 3: Case study
   - Touch 4: Break-up email

3. **Handoff to AE**
   - Qualified opportunity
   - Documented pain/need
   - Meeting scheduled
   - Context transferred

## How to Win With This Style

### For SDRs
- **Focus on activities**: Emails sent, connections made
- **Quality over quantity**: Better 50 targeted than 200 spray
- **Document everything**: Build institutional knowledge
- **Iterate quickly**: Test and improve messaging

### For AEs
- **Respect the handoff**: SDR work is valuable
- **Close the loop**: Give feedback on lead quality
- **Focus on closing**: Don't prospect if you have SDRs
- **Track everything**: Know your metrics cold

### For Managers
- **Hire for process**: Systems thinkers over cowboys
- **Specialize roles**: Don't make AEs prospect
- **Invest in tools**: Automation and data quality
- **Coach on metrics**: Everyone knows their numbers

## Practical Implementation

### Daily SDR Workflow
```
9:00-9:30: List building and research
9:30-11:00: Email outreach (50 touches)
11:00-12:00: LinkedIn engagement
1:00-2:00: Follow-up sequences
2:00-3:00: Call connects
3:00-4:00: Data cleanup and CRM
4:00-5:00: AE handoffs and planning
```

### Email Templates

#### Touch 1: Referral
"Appropriate person at [Company] for ML infrastructure?"

#### Touch 2: Value
"Hi [Name], Following up - we help companies like [peer] reduce ML costs by 75%. Worth a conversation?"

#### Touch 3: Proof
"[Name], Thought you'd find this relevant: [case study of similar company]. Similar challenges at [Company]?"

#### Touch 4: Break-up
"[Name], Haven't heard back so I'll assume ML infrastructure isn't a priority. Would you like me to check back in Q2?"

### Metrics That Matter

#### For SDRs
- Emails sent per day
- Response rate
- Meetings booked
- Meeting hold rate
- Opportunities created

#### For AEs  
- Opportunities worked
- Close rate
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length
- Quota attainment

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Making AEs prospect** - Breaks specialization
2. **Skipping research** - Quality suffers
3. **One-size-fits-all messaging** - Personalization matters
4. **Ignoring metrics** - Can't improve what you don't measure
5. **Hero culture** - Process beats individual heroics

## Technology Stack
- **CRM**: Salesforce (obviously)
- **Sales Engagement**: Outreach/Salesloft
- **Data**: ZoomInfo/Apollo
- **Routing**: LeanData/Chilipiper
- **Analytics**: Gong/Chorus

## When This Approach Works Best
- Defined ICP
- Repeatable sales process
- Growing sales team
- Need predictable pipeline
- B2B sales with clear buyer

## When to Modify
- Very early stage (no product-market fit)
- Highly complex/custom sales
- Relationship-driven industries
- Extremely long sales cycles
- Founder-led sales

## Key Takeaways
1. **Specialization drives efficiency**
2. **Process creates predictability**
3. **Metrics enable optimization**
4. **Quality beats quantity**
5. **Systems beat heroics**

## Sample Outbound Sequence for Your Company

**Email 1**: "Right person for ML infrastructure?"

**Email 2**: "Hi [Name], We help [similar company] serve models 10x faster. Relevant for [Company]?"

**Email 3**: "[Name], [Customer] reduced costs 75% - case study: [link]. Similar goals?"

**Email 4**: "Breaking up - should I check back when ML infrastructure becomes a priority?"

Remember: The goal is to build a machine that predictably generates pipeline, not to rely on sales heroes. Focus on process, measure everything, and continuously optimize.
