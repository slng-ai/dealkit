## Calculator Usage Guidelines

### Data Collection Strategy
Gathering accurate inputs for reliable calculations:

#### Customer Research Phase
```markdown
# Pre-Meeting Data Collection
## Infrastructure Assessment
- Current cloud/server costs (monthly bills)
- Software license expenses (annual contracts)
- Personnel allocation (time spent on relevant tasks)
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput, availability)

## Business Impact Analysis
- Revenue per project/initiative
- Time-to-market for new features
- Cost of downtime or service disruption
- Customer acquisition and retention costs

## Opportunity Quantification
- Delayed project value and timeline
- Competitive disadvantage costs
- Manual process inefficiencies
- Risk and compliance expenses
```

#### Discovery Questions for Calculator Inputs

        'base_case': base_case_inputs,
        'optimistic': apply_variation(base_case_inputs, +0.25),   # 25% higher benefits
        'pessimistic': apply_variation(base_case_inputs, -0.40)   # 40% lower benefits
    }
    
    results = {}
    for scenario_name, inputs in scenarios.items():
        results[scenario_name] = calculate_comprehensive_roi(inputs)
    
    return {
        'scenario_comparison': results,
        'risk_assessment': analyze_scenario_spread(results),
        'confidence_level': calculate_confidence_metrics(results)
    }
```

### Validation and Credibility

#### Data Verification Methods
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Compare inputs to published industry averages
- **Reference Customers**: Validate assumptions with similar customer results
- **Conservative Estimates**: Use lower bound projections for credibility
- **Phased Validation**: Start with pilot metrics and extrapolate carefully
