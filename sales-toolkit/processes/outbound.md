### Objection Responses

**"We're happy with current solution"**
```
"That's great - it's working well for you?

What I'm hearing from [similar companies] is that 
while [current solution] handles the basics, they're 
running into [specific limitation] as they scale.

Have you experienced anything like that, or is 
everything smooth sailing?"
```

**"No budget right now"**
```
"I understand - budget's always a consideration.

Most teams we work with didn't budget for us either 
initially. But once they saw the [specific ROI], 
it became a must-have.

Worth understanding what [specific ROI] would mean 
to your team?"
```

**"Not interested"**
```
"No problem at all. 

Quick question - is it because ML deployment isn't 
a priority, or you've got it handled in-house?"

[Based on response, either end gracefully or probe deeper]
```
