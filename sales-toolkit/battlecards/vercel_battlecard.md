Subject: How TechCorp Cut Hosting Costs 40% (Moving from Vercel)

Hi [Name],

Noticed you're using Vercel. While they pioneered edge deployment, many enterprises are switching to ACME for:

• 44% faster performance (benchmark study attached)
• 35% lower total costs (no surprise overages)
• Enterprise support with 15-minute SLA
• HIPAA compliance for healthcare data

TechCorp switched last quarter and saw:
- Page loads: 2.1s → 1.2s
- Monthly costs: $5,800 → $3,500
- Support response: 4 hours → 15 minutes

Worth a 20-minute demo to see the difference?

P.S. We offer free migration assistance - most customers switch in under a week.
