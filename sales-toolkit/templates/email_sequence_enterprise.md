## Email 1: Problem-Focused Introduction
**Send:** Day 1 (Tuesday/Wednesday optimal)
**Subject:** Quick question about {Company}'s hosting infrastructure

Hi {FirstName},

I noticed {Company} recently {RecentCompanyNews/Growth/Funding} - congrats on the momentum!

As your engineering team scales, I'm curious: are you finding that your current hosting setup can keep pace with your growth without ballooning costs?

We've helped companies like {SimilarCompany1} and {SimilarCompany2} reduce hosting costs by 35% while improving performance. {SimilarCompany1} saw their page load times drop from 2.1s to 1.2s after the switch.

Worth a quick conversation to see if there's a fit?

Best,
{YourName}

P.S. If hosting infrastructure isn't on your radar, I understand - feel free to let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

## Email 2: Social Proof & Credibility
**Send:** Day 4 (Friday optimal)
**Subject:** How {SimilarCompany} reduced hosting costs 40%

Hi {FirstName},

Since you're probably evaluating infrastructure options as {Company} grows, thought you'd find this interesting.

{SimilarCompany} was in a similar position 6 months ago - great product traction but hosting costs were scaling faster than revenue. Their CTO mentioned they were spending $15K/month on AWS with performance issues during traffic spikes.

After switching to our platform:
• Hosting costs down 40% ($9K/month savings)
• Page load times improved 45%
• Zero downtime during their biggest traffic spike yet

The CTO said: "We should have made this change 6 months earlier."

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if there's a similar opportunity for {Company}?

{CalendlyLink}

Best,

## Email 3: Insight/Education
**Send:** Day 8 (Wednesday optimal)
**Subject:** The hidden cost of DIY hosting infrastructure

{FirstName},

Saw an interesting study that 73% of engineering teams spend 20+ hours/month managing hosting infrastructure instead of building features.

At {Company}, how much time does your team spend on:
• Deployment optimization and troubleshooting
• Performance monitoring and scaling
• Security updates and compliance
• Cost optimization across environments

For most companies we work with, it's 2-4 hours per developer per week. That's $50-100K annually in opportunity cost for a 10-person engineering team.

{SimilarCompany} freed up 15 hours/week after switching to our platform. Their lead engineer now focuses on core product features instead of infrastructure headaches.

Worth exploring for {Company}?

## Email 4: Competitive/FOMO
**Send:** Day 11 (Monday optimal)
**Subject:** {Company} vs {Competitor} - infrastructure advantage

{FirstName},

Just wrapped a call with another company in the {Industry} space. They mentioned they're gaining a competitive edge by shipping features 40% faster since switching from traditional hosting.

While their competitors are still dealing with deployment bottlenecks and performance issues, they're focusing entirely on customer value.

As {Company} continues growing in the competitive {Industry} market, infrastructure speed could be a real differentiator.

{SimilarCompany} shipped 3 major features in Q2 that they couldn't have delivered on their old setup. Their CEO credits the infrastructure change with helping them close their Series B.

Would you be interested in a quick conversation about how infrastructure velocity could impact {Company}'s roadmap?

15-minute call: {CalendlyLink}

## Email 5: Final Value Proposition
**Send:** Day 14 (Thursday optimal)
**Subject:** Final thought on {Company}'s infrastructure strategy

{FirstName},

This is my last note on infrastructure optimization for {Company}.

I've been thinking about your recent {RecentCompanyNews} and the engineering challenges that come with rapid growth.

Here's what typically happens:
• Month 1-3: Current infrastructure "works fine"
• Month 4-6: Performance issues during traffic spikes
• Month 7-9: Engineering team spending >50% time on infrastructure
• Month 10-12: Emergency migration under pressure

vs. companies that plan ahead:
• Proactive infrastructure that scales automatically
• Engineering team focused on product features
• Predictable costs as they grow
• Competitive advantage through faster shipping

{SimilarCompany} made the switch proactively and avoided the emergency scramble. Their CTO said it was one of their best technical decisions.

If you'd ever like to explore what this could look like for {Company}, I'm here.

P.S. If infrastructure isn't a priority right now, I totally understand. Just reply "not now" and I'll circle back in 6 months.
