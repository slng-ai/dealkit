# Objection Handling Playbook

## Framework: Feel, Felt, Found Method

### Structure for All Objections:
1. **Feel:** "I understand how you feel..."
2. **Felt:** "Other customers have felt the same way..."
3. **Found:** "What they found was..."
4. **Proof:** Provide specific evidence
5. **Question:** Ask a follow-up to move forward

## Price/Budget Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand the price feels high. Many CFOs have felt the same way when first seeing our proposal. What they found is that the total cost of ownership is actually 35% lower than their current solution when you factor in {hidden costs, productivity gains, reduced maintenance}.

For example, {Customer Company} thought we were 20% more expensive than {Competitor}, but after calculating their true costs - including developer time, downtime, and scaling inefficiencies - they're saving $200K annually.

What would a 35% reduction in your total hosting costs mean for your budget planning?"

### "We don't have budget right now"

**Response:**
"I understand budget timing can be challenging. Many companies have felt constrained by current budget cycles. What they found is that the cost of waiting is often higher than the cost of acting.

{Customer Example} calculated they were losing $50K quarterly by staying with their current solution. They found budget by reallocating from their existing hosting spend plus quantifying the productivity gains.

If we could show you how to fund this from existing budget plus demonstrate clear ROI, would timing still be the main concern?"

### "Your competitor is cheaper"

**Response:**
"I understand price comparison is important. Other customers have felt the same way about upfront costs. What they found is that the cheapest option often becomes the most expensive over time.

{Customer Example} chose a competitor that was 20% cheaper initially. Six months later, they switched to us because hidden costs, downtime, and performance issues made the 'cheaper' solution 40% more expensive.

Would you like to see a total cost of ownership comparison that includes all the hidden costs most people miss?"

## Authority/Decision-Making Objections

### "I need to talk to my team"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, getting team input is crucial for a decision this important. Other executives have felt the same need to build consensus. What they found most helpful was having our technical team present directly to their stakeholders.

{Customer Example} set up a 30-minute technical Q&A with their engineering team, which actually accelerated their decision by addressing concerns directly.

Who are the key people who should be involved, and would a brief technical session help them evaluate our solution more effectively?"

### "My boss needs to approve this"

**Response:**
"Of course, executive approval is essential for strategic decisions like this. Other leaders have felt the same responsibility to get proper authorization. What they found most effective was presenting a business case that clearly articulated the strategic value.

{Customer Example} used our ROI analysis to show their CEO how this decision would impact three key business metrics. The approval happened the same day.

What information would be most compelling for your boss to understand the strategic value of this investment?"

### "We're not the decision maker"

**Response:**
"I appreciate your honesty about the decision process. Many stakeholders have felt unsure about their role in the evaluation. What they found is that their technical input and recommendation carries significant weight in the final decision.

{Customer Example} started as a technical evaluator but became our champion because they understood the impact on their daily work. Their recommendation was the deciding factor.

What would you need to see to feel confident recommending our solution to the decision makers?"

---

## Need/Fit Objections

### "We're happy with our current solution"

**Response:**
"That's great to hear you're satisfied with your current setup. Many successful companies have felt the same way about their existing solutions. What they found is that 'good enough' often prevents them from achieving 'great.'

{Customer Example} was happy with their solution until they saw they could achieve 40% better performance and 30% cost savings. Their CTO said, 'We didn't know what we were missing.'

If you could achieve significantly better results with minimal effort, would that be worth exploring?"

### "This doesn't fit our use case"

**Response:**
"I understand it might not seem like a perfect fit initially. Other customers in {similar industry/situation} have felt the same concern. What they found is that our solution adapts to their specific needs better than they expected.

{Customer Example} had a unique {specific use case} that seemed challenging. Our team worked with them to customize the approach, and now they say it's the best decision they've made.

What specific aspects of your use case do you think might be challenging, and can we explore how we've solved similar issues?"

### "We need features you don't have"

**Response:**
"I understand having all required features is crucial. Other customers have felt concerned about specific capabilities. What they found is that our core platform plus integrations often provide a better solution than built-in features that don't quite fit.

{Customer Example} needed {specific feature} that we don't build natively. Through our API and integration with {partner solution}, they got exactly what they needed - and it works better than competitors' built-in versions.

Which specific features are you most concerned about, and can we show you how we address those needs?"

---

## Trust/Credibility Objections

### "You're too small/new"

**Response:**
"I understand the importance of working with established vendors. Many enterprises have felt the same concern about working with smaller companies. What they found is that our focused approach and dedicated attention actually gives them advantages over larger vendors.

{Customer Example} chose us over {Large Competitor} because we could move quickly, customize our solution, and provide executive-level attention. Their project manager said our responsiveness was 5x better than their previous vendor.

What specific concerns do you have about our company size, and how can we address those through our partnership approach?"

### "We've never heard of you"

**Response:**
"That's understandable - we've been focused on serving our customers rather than marketing broadly. Many of our best customers felt the same way initially. What they found is that our customer focus and technical excellence more than make up for lower brand recognition.

{Customer Example} had never heard of us either, but after talking to our references and seeing our results, they realized we were the best-kept secret in the industry. Now they refer other companies to us regularly.

Would it be helpful to speak with some of our customers in your industry who can share their experience working with us?"

### "What if you go out of business?"

**Response:**
"That's a valid concern for any business relationship. Other enterprises have felt the same way about vendor stability. What they found reassuring is our financial backing, growth trajectory, and customer success rates.

We're backed by {investors}, growing {growth rate}% annually, and have {customer retention rate}% customer retention. {Customer Example} did extensive due diligence on our financial stability and said we were more stable than some public companies they'd evaluated.

Would sharing our financial metrics and investor information help address your concerns about our stability?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "It's not the right time"

**Response:**
"I understand timing needs to align with your business priorities. Many customers have felt the same way about implementation timing. What they found is that waiting for the 'perfect time' often costs more than moving when there's a clear business case.

{Customer Example} delayed their decision by 6 months waiting for a better time. They calculated the delay cost them $100K in inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

What would need to change for the timing to feel right, and what's the cost of waiting another quarter?"

### "We're too busy right now"

**Response:**
"I completely understand - being too busy is often why companies need solutions like ours. Other teams have felt the same way about taking on new projects. What they found is that our solution actually reduces their workload rather than increasing it.

{Customer Example} was overwhelmed with managing their current infrastructure. After implementing our solution, their DevOps team freed up 20 hours per week to focus on strategic projects instead of maintenance.

If we could show you how to reduce your team's current workload while improving your infrastructure, would that change the timing consideration?"

### "We're planning a reorganization"

**Response:**
"Reorganizations definitely create complexity for new initiatives. Other companies have felt the same uncertainty during transitions. What they found is that implementing the right infrastructure actually supports successful reorganizations by providing stability and scalability.

{Customer Example} implemented our solution during a major restructuring. Having reliable infrastructure was one less thing to worry about, and it actually helped them scale their new organization more effectively.

How could having more reliable, scalable infrastructure support your reorganization goals?"

---

## Technical Objections

### "We need to evaluate other options"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, thorough evaluation is important for technical decisions. Many technical teams have felt the same need to compare alternatives. What they found most helpful was understanding specific evaluation criteria upfront.

{Customer Example} evaluated five solutions over three months. They said having clear criteria and structured comparisons made the process much more efficient and led to a better decision.

What are your key evaluation criteria, and how can we help you compare solutions more effectively?"

### "Integration will be too complex"

**Response:**
"Integration complexity is a legitimate concern. Many engineering teams have felt worried about disrupting their current systems. What they found is that our migration approach actually minimizes complexity and risk.

{Customer Example} was concerned about integrating with their complex AWS environment. Our migration ran in parallel with zero downtime, and they said it was the smoothest infrastructure change they'd ever experienced.

What specific integration challenges concern you most, and can we show you how we've solved similar situations?"

### "Security/compliance requirements"

**Response:**
"Security and compliance are absolutely critical. Other security teams have felt the same concerns about new vendors. What they found is that our security posture often exceeds their current standards.

{Customer Example} has the strictest security requirements in their industry. After our security review, their CISO said our controls were more comprehensive than their previous solution.

What specific security or compliance requirements do you need us to address, and can we show you our certifications and security documentation?"
