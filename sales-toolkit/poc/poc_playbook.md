# POC Playbook: From Trial to Triumph

## The "Moment of Confetti" Philosophy ðŸŽ‰

A successful POC creates an undeniable moment where the customer realizes they can't live without your solution. This guide helps you engineer that moment.

## Pre-POC Qualification

### MUST Have Before Starting POC
- [ ] **Economic Buyer Committed**: "If this works, we'll buy"
- [ ] **Success Criteria Defined**: Written and agreed upon
- [ ] **Resources Allocated**: Named technical team members
- [ ] **Timeline Agreed**: Start date, end date, decision date
- [ ] **Budget Confirmed**: "We have budget for this solution"

### Red Flags ðŸš©
- "We're evaluating lots of vendors" (POC as research)
- "Let's just see what it can do" (No clear goals)
- "Our team is really busy right now" (No commitment)
- "Free POC" with no skin in the game

## POC Metrics That Matter

### Technical Metrics
```
Deployment Speed: before vs after
Performance: baseline vs improved
Availability: uptime percentage
Scale: concurrent users handled
Cost: projected savings
```

### Business Metrics
```
Developer Hours Saved: per week
Time to Market: feature velocity
Revenue Impact: faster deployment
Risk Reduction: improved reliability
Team Satisfaction: survey scores
```

## Common POC Patterns
