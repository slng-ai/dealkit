# PoC Framework

For running proof of concept trials with clear success criteria.

## Purpose
This section provides playbooks for running successful proof of concepts (PoCs) that lead to closed deals. A well-structured PoC demonstrates value, builds confidence, and creates momentum toward purchase decisions.

## Key Salesforce Fields
- **Stage**: Opportunity stage tracking
- **Forecast Category**: Pipeline visibility
- **Deal Review**: Executive attention flags

## The "Moment of Confetti" Approach

### Philosophy
Create a clear moment of success that both parties can celebrate - the "confetti moment" when the PoC objectives are achieved and value is proven.

### Three Phases of PoC

#### 1. Pre-PoC Planning
- **Success Criteria Definition**
  - Specific, measurable goals
  - Agreed-upon benchmarks
  - Timeline and milestones
  - Decision criteria post-PoC

- **Resource Alignment**
  - Technical contacts identified
  - Slack channel created
  - Meeting cadence set
  - Escalation paths defined

- **Infrastructure Setup**
  - Credits allocated
  - Accounts provisioned
  - Baseline metrics captured
  - Integration points mapped

#### 2. PoC Execution
- **Week 1**: Environment setup and initial deployment
- **Week 2**: Performance tuning and optimization
- **Week 3**: Full testing and metric collection
- **Week 4**: Results analysis and presentation

- **Regular Checkpoints**
  - Daily Slack standups
  - Weekly progress calls
  - Blocker identification
  - Success metric tracking

#### 3. Post-PoC Conversion
- **Results Documentation**
  - Performance vs. baseline
  - Cost analysis
  - ROI calculation
  - Technical learnings

- **Decision Facilitation**
  - Executive presentation
  - Reference architecture
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Commercial proposal

## PoC Success Framework

### SMART Goals
- **Specific**: "Reduce inference latency to <100ms"
- **Measurable**: Clear metrics and benchmarks
- **Achievable**: Realistic given constraints
- **Relevant**: Tied to business value
- **Time-bound**: Clear start and end dates

### Common PoC Objectives
1. **Performance Validation**
   - Latency requirements
   - Throughput testing
   - Scalability verification
   - Reliability confirmation

2. **Integration Testing**
   - API compatibility
   - Data pipeline integration
   - Monitoring setup
   - Security validation

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Usage pattern analysis
   - Cost per inference
   - Scaling economics
   - Budget alignment

4. **User Experience**
   - Developer workflow
   - Deployment simplicity
   - Debugging capabilities
   - Team enablement

## Common PoC Pitfalls

### To Avoid:
1. **Unclear Success Criteria** - Define specific, measurable goals
2. **Scope Creep** - Stick to agreed objectives
3. **Resource Gaps** - Ensure technical support
4. **Timeline Drift** - Maintain urgency
5. **Weak Conversion** - Plan post-PoC steps

### Recovery Strategies:
- Mid-PoC recalibration
- Executive escalation
- Additional resource allocation
- Success criteria refinement

## Conversion Best Practices

### The "Confetti Moment"
When success criteria are met:
1. Immediate acknowledgment
2. Results documentation
3. Executive notification
4. Conversion conversation
5. Reference request

### Post-PoC Momentum
- Strike while iron is hot
- Remove commercial friction
- Provide implementation plan
- Set go-live date
- Assign implementation team
