# Workspace Security & Data Management

Guidelines for securely managing the sales workspace and handling customer data responsibly.

## Purpose

This section ensures all team members understand and follow security best practices for:
- Protecting customer information in the workspace
- Managing access to sensitive sales data
- Maintaining workspace hygiene and organization
- Responding to security incidents
- Complying with data protection regulations

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Never Store Secrets in Plain Text
- ❌ Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens to Git
- ❌ Never store credentials in Slack or documentation
- ✅ Use environment variables for all secrets
- ✅ Use secret management tools (1Password, LastPass)
- ✅ Rotate credentials regularly

### 2. Limit Access on Need-to-Know Basis
- Customer data access should be role-based
- Regularly review and remove unnecessary access
- Document who has access to what systems
- Use principle of least privilege

### 3. Protect Customer Data
- Treat all customer data as confidential
- Never share customer data outside secure channels
- Anonymize data for demos or training
- Follow data classification guidelines

## Workspace Organization

### Directory Structure Security
```
sales-workspace/
├── customers/          # Restricted access
│   ├── profiles/       # Customer-specific data
│   └── templates/      # Safe to share
├── workspace-setup/    # Admin access only
│   ├── config/         # Contains sensitive configs
│   └── integrations/   # API configurations
└── sales-toolkit/      # General team access
```

### Access Control Matrix
| Directory | Sales Team | Sales Ops | Leadership | External |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| customers/profiles | Read/Write | Full | Read | None |
| workspace-setup | None | Full | Read | None |
| sales-toolkit | Read | Full | Read | Read* |
| reporting | Read own | Full | Full | None |

*External = contractors or partners with NDAs

## Data Classification

### Confidential Data
**Definition**: Data that could harm the company or customers if disclosed

**Examples**:
- Customer contracts and pricing
- Personal information (emails, names, titles)
- Usage data and metrics
- Strategic account plans
- Security questionnaire responses

**Handling**:
- Store only in approved systems
- Encrypt in transit and at rest
- Limit access to need-to-know
- Clear desk/screen policy

### Internal Data
**Definition**: Data for internal use but not highly sensitive

**Examples**:
- Sales playbooks and processes
- General product information
- Team performance metrics
- Training materials

**Handling**:
- Keep within company systems
- OK to share internally
- Use judgment for external sharing

### Public Data
**Definition**: Data intended for public consumption

**Examples**:
- Marketing materials
- Public case studies
- Product documentation
- Pricing pages

**Handling**:
- OK to share freely
- Ensure accuracy
- Version control

## API Key and Integration Security

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Good - Using environment variables
export SLACK_TOKEN="xoxb-..."
export GONG_API_KEY="..."

# Bad - Hardcoding in files
slack_token = "xoxb-12345..."  # NEVER DO THIS
```

### Integration Best Practices
1. **Use `.env` files** (never commit them)
2. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**
3. **Document required variables** (not values)
4. **Use minimal permission scopes**
5. **Rotate keys quarterly**

### Secure Configuration Template
```bash
# .env.example (commit this)
SLACK_TOKEN=your_slack_token_here
GONG_API_KEY=your_gong_key_here
SALESFORCE_USERNAME=your_sf_username
SALESFORCE_PASSWORD=your_sf_password
SALESFORCE_TOKEN=your_sf_token

# .env (never commit this)
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-actual-token-value
GONG_API_KEY=actual-key-value
# ... actual values
```

## Customer Data Handling

### Data Collection Guidelines
- Only collect data necessary for sales process
- Get approval before collecting sensitive data
- Document what data is collected and why
- Follow customer preferences for data handling

### Data Storage Rules
1. **Customer Profiles**: Keep in designated folders
2. **Email Content**: Sanitize before storing
3. **Call Recordings**: Link to source, don't duplicate
4. **Usage Data**: Aggregate and anonymize

### Data Retention Policy
| Data Type | Retention Period | Action After Period |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Active Opportunities | Indefinite | Keep while active |
| Closed Won | 3 years | Archive |
| Closed Lost | 1 year | Delete PII, keep summary |
| Email Threads | 2 years | Archive |
| Call Recordings | 1 year | Delete local, keep link |

### Data Deletion Process
1. Identify data for deletion per policy
2. Export any required summaries
3. Remove from all systems:
   - Local files
   - Cloud storage
   - Integration caches
   - Backups (after cycle)
4. Document deletion in log

## Incident Response

### What Constitutes a Security Incident?
- Unauthorized access to customer data
- Accidental data exposure (email, Slack)
- Lost/stolen device with company data
- Suspicious activity in workspace
- Potential data breach

### Incident Response Steps

- Identify root cause
- Assess impact

#### 4. Remediation
- Fix immediate issue
- Implement preventive measures
- Update processes
- Train team if needed

#### 5. Communication
