            "Win/Loss Analysis",
            "Customer Call Notes",
            "Competitor Research"
        ]
    },
    "google_docs": {
        "folders": [
            "Sales Templates",
            "Email Scripts",
            "Proposals"
        ]
    },
    "slack": {
        "channels": [
            "#sales-wins",
            "#competitive-intel",
            "#lost-deals"
        ]
    }
}
```

### 2. Automatic Monitoring
The system continuously monitors your connected sources for:
- **Success Patterns**: What messages, approaches, and tactics are winning
- **Failure Points**: Where deals stall or customers object

### 3. Intelligent Analysis
Using AI, the system identifies:
- **Effective Messaging**: Phrases and positioning that resonate
- **Common Objections**: Patterns in customer concerns
- **Winning Tactics**: Strategies that advance deals
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Missing content in your toolkit

### 4. Smart Suggestions
Based on analysis, you'll receive:
- **Template Updates**: "Add this proven email sequence variant"
- **Battlecard Enhancements**: "Update competitor X pricing info"
- **Playbook Additions**: "Include this objection handling technique"
- **New Content Needs**: "Create template for emerging use case"

   python set_rules.py --template recommended
   ```

3. **Review First Suggestions**
   ```bash
   python show_suggestions.py --last 7d
   ```

4. **Enable Automation** (Optional)
