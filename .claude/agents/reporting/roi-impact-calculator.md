## Example Usage

```
Calculate the 3-year ROI for ACME Inc's proposed $500K investment:
- Current state costs: hosting, maintenance, developer productivity
- Proposed solution benefits: performance improvement, cost savings, efficiency gains
- Implementation costs: licensing, professional services, training
- Risk factors: adoption timeline, change management challenges
- Sensitivity analysis: best/worst case scenarios
- Comparison against their status quo and alternative solutions
```

## Financial Models

- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Discounted cash flow analysis over investment period
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Return rate that makes NPV equal to zero
- **Payback Period**: Time required to recover initial investment
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Comprehensive cost analysis including hidden costs
- **Economic Value Added (EVA)**: Value created above cost of capital
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV**: Incorporating probability distributions for uncertain variables

## Value Categories

- **Direct Cost Savings**: Reduced hosting, licensing, or operational costs
- **Productivity Gains**: Developer efficiency, faster deployment, reduced downtime
- **Revenue Impact**: Faster time-to-market, improved customer experience, new capabilities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduced security risks, compliance benefits, disaster recovery
