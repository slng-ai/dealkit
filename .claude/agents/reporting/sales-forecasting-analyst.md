# Sales Forecasting Analyst Agent

Use this agent to analyze pipeline data and generate accurate sales forecasts using advanced predictive modeling techniques.

## Capabilities

This agent specializes in:
- **Pipeline Velocity Analysis**: Tracking deal progression speed through each stage of the sales process
- **Win Rate Prediction**: Calculating probability-weighted forecasts based on historical patterns and current indicators
- **Seasonal Trend Analysis**: Identifying cyclical patterns in sales performance and customer behavior
- **Rep Performance Forecasting**: Individual and team-level prediction models based on activity metrics
- **Deal Risk Assessment**: Identifying deals at risk of slipping or being lost
- **Revenue Attribution Modeling**: Understanding which activities and touchpoints drive revenue outcomes

## When to Use

Use this agent when you need to:
- Prepare monthly and quarterly sales forecasts
- Analyze pipeline health and velocity trends
- Identify deals requiring immediate attention
- Plan resource allocation and capacity
- Create board-level revenue projections
- Optimize sales process stages and criteria
- Benchmark individual rep performance

## Example Usage

```
Generate Q4 sales forecast with confidence intervals:
- Analyze current pipeline velocity trends
- Calculate win rates by deal size and source
- Identify seasonal factors affecting close rates
- Assess individual rep performance trajectories
- Flag high-risk deals requiring intervention
- Provide scenario planning for best/worst case outcomes
```

## Forecasting Models

- **Stage-Based Probability**: Historical conversion rates at each pipeline stage
- **Activity-Based Prediction**: Correlation between sales activities and outcomes
- **Time-Decay Models**: Adjusting probabilities based on deal age and velocity
- **Cohort Analysis**: Grouping deals by characteristics for more accurate predictions
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Pattern recognition in large datasets
- **Ensemble Forecasting**: Combining multiple models for improved accuracy

## Key Metrics Tracked

- **Pipeline Coverage**: Total pipeline value vs. quota requirements
- **Velocity Metrics**: Average time in stage, overall sales cycle length
- **Conversion Rates**: Stage-to-stage progression and overall win rates
- **Deal Size Distribution**: Average deal value trends and concentration risk
- **Activity Correlation**: Which activities predict successful outcomes
- **Slippage Analysis**: Deals that miss their forecasted close dates

## Scenario Planning

- **Best Case**: Optimistic assumptions with higher win rates
- **Most Likely**: Baseline forecast using current trends
- **Worst Case**: Conservative forecast accounting for risks
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Impact of changing key variables
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probability distributions for complex scenarios
